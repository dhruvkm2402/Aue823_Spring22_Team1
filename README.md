1. The folder contains all packages used in course of **Autonomy Science and Systems**. Each folder is a **catkin package** and use **catkin_make** to build the workspace for your use case
2. The ==**assignment3_g1**== folder contains scripts, launch files of turtlebot traversing square and circle trajectories in Gazebo simulation and also implementation of Autonmous Emergency braking in simulation.
4. The **assignment4_sim2real** folder contains scripts, launch files of turtlebot traversing square and circle trajectories in real world scenario.
5. The **assignment5** folder contains scripts, launch files of turtlebot performing **wall following** in simulation and **obstacle avoidance** in both simulation and real world. 
6. **assignment6_trackingandfollowing** folder contains scripts, launch files of turtlebot performing **line following** and **April tag tracking** in both simulation and real world. 
7. **assignment7_slam** folder contains scripts, launch files of turtlebot performing slam algorithm on an environment utilsizing different slam algorithms such as **gmapping and karto slam** and comparison of 2D lidar and 3D lidar
8. The **aue_finals** folder contains **scripts, launch, world, models and respective april tag files** performing **wall following, obstacle avoidance, line following, Stop sign detection and april tag tracking** in a gazebo world as part of **simulation** and also on a **track as part of final project**.
9. The **gazebo_apriltag** folder contains april tag images and **models for april tag images** to add these images in gazebo world.
